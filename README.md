4. Getting Started
   
notebook.ipynb
Download the project.
Open your preferred IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (in this example, I'll be using Google Colab).
Create a new notebook.
Upload and select the file with the .ipynb extension.
Connect to the available runtime.
Finally, run the code cells.

dashboard/dashboard.py
Download the project.
Install Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt by running the command pip install streamlit. If you haven't installed other libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn, install those as well.
Please note, do not move the CSV file as it acts as the data source. Keep it in the same folder as dashboard.py.
Open VSCode and run the file by opening the terminal and typing streamlit run dashboard.py.
